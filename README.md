# AI DeepDive Handbook

![AI DeepDive](https://img.shields.io/badge/Handbook-AI%20DeepDive-blue?style=flat-square) ![Build](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-brightgreen?style=flat-square) ![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/coverage-unknown-lightgrey?style=flat-square)  
📘 A compact, single-file interactive handbook that explains modern AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) — from core maths to agentic systems — using visual, runnable animations and concise explanations.

## At a Glance 🔎

- **Concise:** Focused explanations that build intuition quickly.
- **Interactive:** Embedded visualizations (attention heatmaps, matrix animations, embedding spaces).
- **Self-contained:** Single `index.html` file with styles and scripts.

## What’s Inside 📚

- **Foundations** — vectors, tensors, numeric intuition, and memory basics for performance reasoning.
- **Transformer Architecture** — tokenization, embeddings, attention mechanics, and context/window tradeoffs.
- **Training & Models** — parameter counts, training vs inference, and common hyperparameters.
- **Deployment & Optimization** — model formats, quantization strategies, and LoRA / QLoRA techniques.
- **Advanced Topics** — Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), RLHF, agent patterns, MCP, and memory systems.
- **Practical Roadmap & Glossary** — suggested learning path, concise references, and FAQs.

## Key Features ✨

- **Single-file handbook:** Everything in one HTML file for easy linking and archiving.
- **Interactive demos:** Playable visualizations to make abstract concepts tangible.
- **Illustrative examples:** Simplified numbers and diagrams to highlight core ideas.
- **Responsive design:** Readable on desktop and mobile screens.

## Contributing 🛠️

- Improvements and corrections are welcome. Small, focused pull requests are easiest to review.
- If you prefer, open an issue describing the change and we can iterate together.

## Changelog 📝

- **2026-01-09** — Polished README layout, added header badge, section emojis, concise changelog, and GitHub-style status badges (build & coverage).

## Notes 🗒️

- This is an educational resource: some examples use simplified numbers and visuals to build intuition.
- Model/vendor APIs and pricing change frequently; treat any cost/performance figures as illustrative.

No license has been added yet. If you want, tell me which license you prefer (MIT / Apache-2.0 / CC BY 4.0 / other) and I’ll add it cleanly.
